# Budurasmala (බුදුරැස්මාලා) Custom LED Matrix

## Overview
The **Budurasmala (බුදුරැස්මාලා)** project features a **circular LED matrix** design using **100 WS2811 pixel LEDs**. This setup offers a unique and efficient alternative to traditional grid-based LED matrices. The circular layout ensures that LEDs are evenly spaced, minimizing wasted space and maximizing the display area. With customizable dimensions and a variety of lighting styles, this project is perfect for both small and large displays.

## Features
- **100 WS2811 Pixel LEDs**: The project uses 100 individually addressable WS2811 LEDs, which offer full RGB control and excellent brightness.
- **Circular LED Layout**: LEDs are arranged in a circle with equal spacing, providing a more visually appealing and efficient design.
- **At Least 7 Lighting Styles**: The project includes at least 7 pre-programmed lighting styles to showcase different effects.
- **Arduino-Compatible**: Works seamlessly with Arduino boards like the Arduino Uno, Nano, or similar.
- **Efficient Use of Space**: The circular design optimizes space usage compared to traditional grid matrices.

## Hardware Requirements
- **100 WS2811 Pixel LEDs** (or other compatible WS2811-based LEDs)
- **Arduino board** (e.g., Arduino Uno, Arduino Nano, etc.)
- **Resistors** (for LED wiring, if necessary)
- **Power Supply** (adequate for 100 LEDs, typically 5V)
- **Jumper Wires** (for wiring the LEDs to the Arduino)
- **Breadboard** (optional, for testing)

## Software Requirements
- **Arduino IDE**: You’ll need the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) to program the Arduino.
- **Adafruit NeoPixel Library**: This library is used to control WS2811 pixel LEDs and other NeoPixel-compatible LEDs.
